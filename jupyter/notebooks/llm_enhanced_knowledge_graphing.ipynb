    "The Campaign’s response to reports about Russian support for Trump. During the 2016\n",
    "presidential campaign, questions arose about the Russian government’s apparent support for\n",
    "candidate Trump. After WikiLeaks released politically damaging Democratic Party emails that\n",
    "were reported to have been hacked by Russia, Trump publicly expressed skepticism that Russia\n",
    "was responsible for the hacks at the same time that he and other Campaign officials privately\n",
    "sought information from Trump associate Roger Stone about any further planned WikiLeaks\n",
    "releases. Trump also denied having any business in or connections to Russia, even though as late\n",
    "as June 2016 the Trump Organization had been pursuing a licensing deal for a skyscraper to be\n",
    "built in Russia called Trump Tower Moscow. After the election, the President expressed concerns\n",
    "to advisors that reports of Russia’s election interference might lead the public to question the\n",
    "legitimacy of his election.\n",
    "Conduct involving FBI Director Comey and Michael Flynn. In mid-January 2017,\n",
    "incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn falsely denied to the Vice President, other\n",
    "administration officials, and FBI agents that he had talked to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak\n",
    "about Russia’s response to U.S. sanctions on Russia for its election interference. On January 27,\n",
    "the day after the President was told that Flynn had lied to the Vice President and had made similar\n",
    "statements to the FBI, the President invited FBI Director Comey to a private dinner at the White\n",
    "House and told Comey that he needed loyalty. On February 14, the day after the President\n",
    "requested Flynn’s resignation, the President told an outside advisor, “Now that we fired Flynn, the\n",
    "Russia thing is over.” The advisor disagreed and said the investigations would continue.\n",
    "Later that afternoon, the President cleared the Oval Office to have a one-on-one meeting\n",
    "with Comey. Referring to the FBI’s investigation of Flynn, the President said, “I hope you can\n",
    "see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this\n",
    "go.” Shortly after requesting Flynn’s resignation and speaking privately to Comey, the President\n",
    "sought to have Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland draft an internal letter stating\n",
    "that the President had not directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak. McFarland declined\n",
    "because she did not know whether that was true, and a White House Counsel’s Office attorney\n",
    "thought that the request would look like a quid pro quo for an ambassadorship she had been offered.\n",
    "The President’s reaction to the continuing Russia investigation. In February 2017,\n",
    "Attorney General Jeff Sessions began to assess whether he had to recuse himself from campaign-\n",
    "related investigations because of his role in the Trump Campaign. In early March, the President\n",
    "told White House Counsel Donald McGahn to stop Sessions from recusing. And after Sessions\n",
    "announced his recusal on March 2, the President expressed anger at the decision and told advisors\n",
    "that he should have an Attorney General who would protect him. That weekend, the President\n",
    "took Sessions aside at an event and urged him to “unrecuse.” Later in March, Comey publicly\n",

    "efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,” including any links or coordination between\n",
    "the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. In the following days, the President reached\n",
    "out to the Director of National Intelligence and the leaders of the Central Intelligence Agency\n",
    "(CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) to ask them what they could do to publicly dispel\n",
    "the suggestion that the President had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort.\n",
    "The President also twice called Comey directly, notwithstanding guidance from McGahn to avoid\n",
    "direct contacts with the Department of Justice. Comey had previously assured the President that\n",
    "the FBI was not investigating him personally, and the President asked Comey to “lift the cloud”\n",
    "of the Russia investigation by saying that publicly.\n",
    "The President’s termination of Comey. On May 3, 2017, Comey testified in a\n",
    "congressional hearing, but declined to answer questions about whether the President was\n",
    "personally under investigation. Within days, the President decided to terminate Comey. The\n",
    "President insisted that the termination letter, which was written for public release, state that Comey\n",
    "had informed the President that he was not under investigation. The day of the firing, the White\n",
    "House maintained that Comey’s termination resulted from independent recommendations from the\n",
    "Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General that Comey should be discharged for mishandling\n",
    "the Hillary Clinton email investigation. But the President had decided to fire Comey before\n",

    "officials that he had “faced great pressure because of Russia,” which had been “taken off” by\n",

    "appointed by telling advisors that it was “the end of his presidency” and demanding that Sessions\n",
    "resign. Sessions submitted his resignation, but the President ultimately did not accept it. The\n",

    "meritless and had already been considered by the Department of Justice.\n",
    "On June 14, 2017, the media reported that the Special Counsel’s Office was investigating\n",

    "the investigation: while Comey had told the President he was not under investigation, following\n",
    "Comey’s firing, the President now was under investigation. The President reacted to this news\n",
    "with a series of tweets criticizing the Department of Justice and the Special Counsel’s\n",
    "investigation. On June 17, 2017, the President called McGahn at home and directed him to call\n",
    "the Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be\n",
    "removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather\n",

    "Efforts to curtail the Special Counsel’s investigation. Two days after directing McGahn\n",
    "to have the Special Counsel removed, the President made another attempt to affect the course of\n",
    "the Russia investigation. On June 19, 2017, the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with\n",
    "his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a trusted advisor outside the government, and\n",
    "dictated a message for Lewandowski to deliver to Sessions. The message said that Sessions should\n",
    "publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation, the investigation\n",
    "was “very unfair” to the President, the President had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to\n",
    "meet with the Special Counsel and “let [him] move forward with investigating election meddling\n",
    "for future elections.” Lewandowski said he understood what the President wanted Sessions to do.\n",
    "One month later, in another private meeting with Lewandowski on July 19, 2017, the\n",
    "President asked about the status of his message for Sessions to limit the Special Counsel\n",
    "investigation to future election interference. Lewandowski told the President that the message\n",
    "would be delivered soon. Hours after that meeting, the President publicly criticized Sessions in an\n",
    "interview with the New York Times, and then issued a series of tweets making it clear that\n",
    "Sessions’s job was in jeopardy. Lewandowski did not want to deliver the President’s message\n",
    "personally, so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions.\n",
    "Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through.\n",
    "Efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence. In the summer of 2017, the President\n",
    "learned that media outlets were asking questions about the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower\n",
    "between senior campaign officials, including Donald Trump Jr., and a Russian lawyer who was\n",
    "said to be offering damaging information about Hillary Clinton as “part of Russia and its\n",
    "government’s support for Mr. Trump.” On several occasions, the President directed aides not to\n",
    "publicly disclose the emails setting up the June 9 meeting, suggesting that the emails would not\n",
    "leak and that the number of lawyers with access to them should be limited. Before the emails\n",
    "became public, the President edited a press statement for Trump Jr. by deleting a line that\n",
    "acknowledged that the meeting was with “an individual who [Trump Jr.] was told might have\n",
    "information helpful to the campaign” and instead said only that the meeting was about adoptions\n",
    "of Russian children. When the press asked questions about the President’s involvement in Trump\n",
    "Jr.’s statement, the President’s personal lawyer repeatedly denied the President had played any\n",
    "role.\n",
    "Further efforts to have the Attorney General take control of the investigation. In early\n",
    "summer 2017, the President called Sessions at home and again asked him to reverse his recusal\n",
    "from the Russia investigation. Sessions did not reverse his recusal. In October 2017, the President\n",
    "met privately with Sessions in the Oval Office and asked him to “take [a] look” at investigating\n",
    "Clinton. In December 2017, shortly after Flynn pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation\n",
    "agreement, the President met with Sessions in the Oval Office and suggested, according to notes\n",
    "taken by a senior advisor, that if Sessions unrecused and took back supervision of the Russia\n",
    "investigation, he would be a “hero.” The President told Sessions, “I’m not going to do anything\n",
    "or direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly.” In response, Sessions volunteered\n",
    "that he had never seen anything “improper” on the campaign and told the President there was a\n",
    "“whole new leadership team” in place. He did not unrecuse.\n",
    "Efforts to have McGahn deny that the President had ordered him to have the Special\n",
    "Counsel removed. In early 2018, the press reported that the President had directed McGahn to\n",

    "officials to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to\n",
    "have the Special Counsel removed. McGahn told those officials that the media reports were\n",
    "accurate in stating that the President had directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed.\n",
    "The President then met with McGahn in the Oval Office and again pressured him to deny the\n",
    "reports. In the same meeting, the President also asked McGahn why he had told the Special\n",
    "Counsel about the President’s effort to remove the Special Counsel and why McGahn took notes\n",
    "of his conversations with the President. McGahn refused to back away from what he remembered\n",

    "Conduct towards Flynn, Manafort, and Stone. After Flynn withdrew from a joint defense\n",
    "agreement with the President and began cooperating with the government, the President’s personal\n",
    "counsel left a message for Flynn’s attorneys reminding them of the President’s warm feelings\n",
    "towards Flynn, which he said “still remains,” and asking for a “heads up” if Flynn knew\n",
    "“information that implicates the President.” When Flynn’s counsel reiterated that Flynn could no\n",
    "longer share information pursuant to a joint defense agreement, the President’s personal counsel\n",
    "said he would make sure that the President knew that Flynn’s actions reflected “hostility” towards\n",
    "the President. During Manafort’s prosecution and when the jury in his criminal trial was\n",
    "deliberating, the President praised Manafort in public, said that Manafort was being treated\n",
    "unfairly, and declined to rule out a pardon. After Manafort was convicted, the President called\n",
    "Manafort “a brave man” for refusing to “break” and said that “flipping” “almost ought to be\n",
    "outlawed.” After Roger Stone publicly announced that he would not cooperate with prosecutors,\n",
    "the President called Stone “very brave” and said he had “guts!” for not “testify[ing] against\n",
    "Trump.”\n",
    "Conduct involving Michael Cohen. The President’s conduct towards Michael Cohen, a\n",
    "former Trump Organization executive, changed from praise for Cohen when he falsely minimized\n",
    "the President’s involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow project, to castigation of Cohen when\n",
    "he became a cooperating witness. From September 2015 to June 2016, Cohen had pursued the\n",
    "Trump Tower Moscow project on behalf of the Trump Organization and had briefed candidate\n",
    "Trump on the project numerous times, including discussing whether Trump should travel to Russia\n",
    "to advance the deal. In 2017, Cohen provided false testimony to Congress about the project,\n",
    "including stating that he had only briefed Trump on the project three times and never discussed\n",
    "travel to Russia with him, in an effort to adhere to a “party line” that Cohen said was developed to\n",
    "minimize the President’s connections to Russia. While preparing for his congressional testimony,\n",
    "Cohen had extensive discussions with the President’s personal counsel, who, according to Cohen,\n",
    "said that Cohen should “stay on message” and not contradict the President. After the FBI searched\n",
    "Cohen’s home and office in April 2018, the President publicly asserted that Cohen would not\n",
    "“flip,” contacted him directly to tell him to “stay strong,” and privately passed messages of support\n",
    "to him. Cohen also discussed pardons with the President’s personal counsel and believed that if\n",
    "he stayed on message he would be taken care of. But after Cohen began cooperating with the\n",
    "government in the summer of 2018, the President publicly criticized him, called him a “rat,” and\n",
    "suggested that his family members had committed crimes.\n",

    "Overarching factual issues. We did not make a traditional prosecution decision about\n",
    "these facts, but the evidence we obtained supports several general statements about the President’s\n",
    "conduct.\n",
    "Several features of the conduct we investigated distinguish it from typical obstruction-of-\n",
    "justice cases. First, the investigation concerned the President, and some of his actions, such as\n",
    "firing the FBI director, involved facially lawful acts within his Article II authority, which raises\n",
    "constitutional issues discussed below. At the same time, the President’s position as the head of\n",
    "the Executive Branch provided him with unique and powerful means of influencing official\n",
    "proceedings, subordinate officers, and potential witnesses—all of which is relevant to a potential\n",
    "obstruction-of-justice analysis. Second, unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of\n",
    "justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was\n",
    "involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference. Although the obstruction\n",
    "statutes do not require proof of such a crime, the absence of that evidence affects the analysis of\n",
    "the President’s intent and requires consideration of other possible motives for his conduct. Third,\n",
    "many of the President’s acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation with\n",
    "the government and suggestions of possible future pardons, took place in public view. That\n",
    "circumstance is unusual, but no principle of law excludes public acts from the reach of the\n",
    "obstruction laws. If the likely effect of public acts is to influence witnesses or alter their testimony,\n",
    "the harm to the justice system’s integrity is the same.\n",
    "Although the series of events we investigated involved discrete acts, the overall pattern of\n",
    "the President’s conduct towards the investigations can shed light on the nature of the President’s\n",
    "acts and the inferences that can be drawn about his intent. In particular, the actions we investigated\n",
    "can be divided into two phases, reflecting a possible shift in the President’s motives. The first\n",
    "phase covered the period from the President’s first interactions with Comey through the President’s\n",
    "firing of Comey. During that time, the President had been repeatedly told he was not personally\n",
    "under investigation. Soon after the firing of Comey and the appointment of the Special Counsel,\n",
    "however, the President became aware that his own conduct was being investigated in an\n",
    "obstruction-of-justice inquiry. At that point, the President engaged in a second phase of conduct,\n",
    "involving public attacks on the investigation, non-public efforts to control it, and efforts in both\n",
    "public and private to encourage witnesses not to cooperate with the investigation. Judgments about\n",
    "the nature of the President’s motives during each phase would be informed by the totality of the\n",
    "evidence.\n",
